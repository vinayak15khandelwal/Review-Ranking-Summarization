# Intelligent Review Ranking System Using Ant Colony Optimization with NLP-Based Feature Extraction

## Problem Statement

Online platforms generate a large number of user reviews, making it difficult for users to quickly identify the most relevant and informative feedback.

This project proposes an intelligent review ranking and summarization framework that combines Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with NLP-based feature extraction techniques. The system ranks reviews based on their importance and helps users access concise and meaningful information more efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project implements a review ranking system using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to rank product reviews based on importance using multiple extracted features.

## System Architecture

The proposed framework combines NLP-based feature extraction with Ant Colony Optimization to rank reviews according to their relevance and importance.

## Methodology

1. Feature Extraction

   * Sentiment using VADER
   * Review length
   * Helpfulness ratio
   * Freshness

2. Feature normalization

3. ACO optimization

   * Ants generate candidate weight vectors
   * Fitness evaluated using correlation
   * Pheromone updated iteratively

4. Ranking

   * Final score = weighted combination of features

## Evaluation Metrics

* Pearson Correlation
* Precision@K
* NDCG

---

## Notes

* Ensure Excel file is closed before writing output
* Dataset size can be adjusted in the loading script
